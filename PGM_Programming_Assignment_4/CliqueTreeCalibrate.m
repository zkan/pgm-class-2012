%CLIQUETREECALIBRATE Performs sum-product or max-product algorithm for 
%clique tree calibration.

%   P = CLIQUETREECALIBRATE(P, isMax) calibrates a given clique tree, P 
%   according to the value of isMax flag. If isMax is 1, it uses max-sum
%   message passing, otherwise uses sum-product. This function 
%   returns the clique tree where the .val for each clique in .cliqueList
%   is set to the final calibrated potentials.

% While there are ready cliques to pass messages between, keep passing
% messages. Use GetNextCliques to find cliques to pass messages between.
% Once you have clique i that is ready to send message to clique
% j, compute the message and put it in MESSAGES(i,j).
% Remember that you only need an upward pass and a downward pass.
